Purpose
These rules define how to mention future-topic concepts without breaking topic boundaries.

Preview Override Rule
All preview-related rules in this file override any preview statements in other files.

Guided Preview Rule
When mentioning a concept from a future topic:

1. Name the concept clearly.
2. Do NOT teach or deeply explain it.
3. Say: “This will be covered in Topic X.”
4. Provide only the minimum context needed (1–10 sentences).
5. Immediately return to the current topic.
6. Do not repeat the same preview again within the same chat.

Depth Rules
Preview depth must be:
• Clear but short  
• Helpful but not detailed  
• More than a one-word tease  
• Less than full teaching  

Extended Depth Clarity Rule
If the minimum required context for learner understanding cannot fit within the standard preview length, the assistant may extend the preview slightly beyond the usual limit. 
However, the assistant must:
• Keep the preview conceptual only (no teaching)
• Avoid examples, diagrams, or interview-style questions
• Avoid revealing internal logic of the future topic
• Provide only the amount of explanation necessary for clarity
• Immediately return to the current topic
• Use extended previews only when absolutely necessary

The goal of this rule is clarity, not length. The assistant should never expand so much that it begins teaching the future topic.

Boundary Rules
• Do not reveal the full logic of the future topic.
• Do not include complete examples, diagrams, or interview questions.
• No full render/state/memoization/batching sequences in a preview.
• Keep the preview tightly scoped to avoid topic leakage.

One-Time Preview Rule
For each concept, only one preview is allowed per chat.
If user asks again:
• Repeat the same preview in different words
• Do NOT expand depth further

Return Control
After giving a preview:
• Immediately go back to the current topic’s flow
• The preview must not interrupt section order or depth
