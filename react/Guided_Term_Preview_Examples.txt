These examples demonstrate how to briefly preview a future topic
without fully teaching it. They give just enough clarity to avoid
confusion while keeping strict topic boundaries.

Rendering Mechanics → Reconciliation (Future Topic)

“When the UI updates, the library compares the previous virtual tree 
with the freshly generated one. The internal algorithm that performs 
this comparison is known as the reconciliation process. It decides 
which parts of the UI need real updates and which can stay untouched. 
We will explore this algorithm deeply in Topic 9. For now, just keep 
in mind that reconciliation is the system’s way of determining what
actually changed.”

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Hooks → Memoization (Future Topic)

“Sometimes re-renders can be skipped when certain inputs remain the same. 
Memoization tools help the system remember previous calculations or 
component outputs so it doesn’t redo them every time. These mechanisms 
greatly improve performance in large or dynamic UIs. We will go into 
full detail in Topic 14. For now, think of memoization as a selective 
memory that reduces unnecessary work.”

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Effects → Cleanup Logic (Future Topic)

“Some side effects allocate resources or set up subscriptions that must 
be cleaned up later. Cleanup logic runs before the effect executes again 
or when the component is removed from the screen. It prevents memory 
leaks and stale behavior. We will study this fully in Topic 7. For now, 
just understand cleanup as the ‘undo’ or ‘reset’ step for effects.”

──────────────────────────────────────────────
State → Batching Behavior (Future Topic)

“When multiple updates happen within the same event, the system may group 
them into a single render cycle. This grouping is called batching. It avoids 
extra work and improves performance. The full details of batching and how 
it interacts with async logic will be covered in Topic 11. For now, just 
remember that batching means combining several updates into one render.”

──────────────────────────────────────────────
Context → Provider/Consumer Flow (Future Topic)

“Some values need to be shared across many components without passing
them manually through every level. The mechanism that supports this is 
the provider → consumer flow. It allows deeply nested parts of the UI 
to access shared data efficiently. We will explore this in Topic 15. 
For now, think of it as a structured channel for passing global data.”
