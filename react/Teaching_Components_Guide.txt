This guide defines optional teaching components that may be used in any
learning project. These components support clarity, depth, and practical
understanding. They do not override project rules; they only explain the
meaning and usage of each component.


Teaching Component Definitions

Mental Models and Analogies
Use when they help the learner intuitively understand how something behaves.
Analogies should support the real behaviour, not replace it. Mental models
should make invisible concepts “visible” in the learner’s mind.

Diagrams
Use diagrams when visualising a process is clearer than describing it.
Avoid diagrams when they add unnecessary noise.

Deep Practical Examples
Use realistic examples similar to production code. For every example:
- Explain the initial trigger
- Explain what causes each update or re-render
- Show how data/state/variables change
- Explain what comparisons or evaluations occur
- Describe why the final output or result appears

Interview Theory Questions
Use when the topic is commonly asked in interviews. Provide structured,
clear answers with proper terminology and reasoning.

Output-Based Questions
Use when the topic relates to updates, rendering, state changes, ordering,
memoization, async behaviour, or evaluations. Explain each step and show
how the final output is produced.

Trick Questions
Use only for topics that are frequently misunderstood. After the trick:
- Explain why the wrong answer is common
- Correct the mental model step by step
- Reinforce the true behaviour clearly

Mini Coding Tasks
Provide short tasks to reinforce understanding. Conceptual tasks should
include clear solutions. Exploratory tasks may be left open-ended.

Revision Summary
Use to restate the key points, common mistakes, and long-term rules to
remember. Keep it concise and high-value.
